# _firstNodeProject_
This is my first complete Node Project based of Udemy course "Web Development Bootcamp" by Colt Steele.

**Main Features**
  1. Elegant bootstrap styles.
  2. RESTFul Routings implemented
  3. User Authentications implemented with localStrategies of Passport
  4. User Authorizations maintained
  5. Error handling with bootstrap styled flash messages.
  6. Implemented async/await . Not all routes are up to date with it as I was not familiar with them when I started working on the project.
      Will try to replace the routes which uses callbacks with them in the near future.
  7. MongoDB used as the database with multiple collections.

**Features to Add in the future**
  1. Google Maps Api Integration
  2. Handling HTTP requests from client sides asynchronously.
  3. Handling password resets for existing users.
